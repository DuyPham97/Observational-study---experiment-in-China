In summary, the author used randomization to create one control and three treatment groups. 
The authors conducted treatment on all three treatment groups; however, not all treatment subjects responsed to the treatment. 
Due to the lack of responses, the randomization failed to provide a unbiased experimental design; therefore, difference in differences technique 
should not be used in this case. Instead, matching in observational study is a better choice. 

My codes in this repository pointed out how to improve the analysis of the randomized experiment. I created some boundaries and applied checking on sensitivity bias. 
In addition, I also conducted generative matching instead of difference-in-differences. Using matching, the result in table 3 reverted, 
with the second treatment turns out to have the most significant impact compared to two other treatment groups
